# DELTAWARP
A recreation of Toby Fox's Deltarune using Scratch 3.0 and TurboWarp.

This engine is the sequal to Underscratch, which was an older Undertale styled engine developed back in 2017, using Scratch 2.0.

Compared to Underscratch, Deltawarp includes the following:
- Fancier Animations
- Multiple enemy types
- More accurate gameplay
- Nicer graphics
- Higher quality sounds
- A whole new (and better) text engine
- 60FPS (Underscratch had 30FPS)
- Mobile Controls
- Gamepad support
- The ability to reset
- MUCH better soul collision

If you wish to take a look at an example project that ran on Underscratch, feel free to check out https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/168307508/. (Note: It was pretty bad.)

If you happen to find any bugs in the project, please feel free to contact @Spectrus#2021 on Discord!
